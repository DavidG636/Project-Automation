# Project-Automation
This project was inspired by [Kalle Hallden's ProjectInitializationAutomation project](https://github.com/KalleHallden/ProjectInitializationAutomation). This is my version but using the windows operating system. The code executes the commands which I would normally manually type in when creating a project.

### Install: 
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/DavidG636/Project-Automation.git"
cd Project-Automation
pip install PyGithub

Then go to createProject.py and set the username and password to be your current username and password.
Also make sure to change all directories as stated in the file
```

### Usage:
```bash
Make sure the createProject.bat file is in your System32 folder.
To run the script type in 'createProject nameOfYourFolder'
```
