# Project-Automation
This project was inspired by [Kalle Hallden's ProjectInitializationAutomation project](https://github.com/KalleHallden/ProjectInitializationAutomation). This is my version but using the windows operating system. The code executes the commands which I would normally manually type in when creating a project.

### Install: 
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/DavidG636/Project-Automation.git"
cd Project-Automation
pip install PyGithub

Then go to create.py and set the username and password to be your username and password.
Also make sure to change all directories to your directories so it should be '/Users/<your username>/path/to/your/project'
```

### Usage:
```bash
To run the script type in 'createProject nameOfYourFolder'
```
